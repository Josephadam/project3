CS 210 Project 3 Coner Grocer

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?
   This code will be a grocery management that checks the frequency of each item. It can also delete items off the text file and then       save it to a new file.
   
2. What did you do particularly well?
   What I did particularly well was that my do while loopa dn switch was a effective way to loop through each question.
   
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   I could have enchanced my code where even if you type in lower case letters it will still count as the input and find values that are    upper case or lower case in first character.
   
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   I found the the whole project challenenging but then i went back to the labs and looked at my older porjects so I can see how i can      make it work.
   
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   The skills I leaned from the project was how to problem solve which is very important when programming and how tot break down each       fucntion.
   
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   I made the code manageable by making a header, source, and class file to better organize my code and i also left comments.
