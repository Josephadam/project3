CS 210 Project 3 Coner Grocer

1. This code will be a grocery management that checks the frequency of each item. It can also delete items off the text file and then save it to a new file.
2. What I did particularly well was that my do while loopa dn switch was a effective way to loop through each question.
3. I could have enchanced my code where even if you type in lower case letters it will still count as the input and find values that are upper case or lower case in first character.
4. I found the the whole project challenenging but then i went back to the labs and looked at my older porjects so I can see how i can make it work.
5. The skills I leaned from the project was how to problem solve which is very important when programming and how tot break down each fucntion.
6. I made the code manageable by making a header, source, and class file to better organize my code and i also left comments.
